**Background Info**
<br>
*Introduction to Cryptography*
- Cryptography, or the writing and solving of written codes, has a wide amount of uses. 
- Ciphers, what we call the written codes, can have uses ranging from:
  - Harmless entertainment
  - Important encrpytion and decrption of messages
  - Pass messages 
  - Information and data protection for modern electronic security technologies
<br>
What many do not realize though is that cryptography, and linguistsics, *finds its foundations in probability*, and the english language structure can be modeled probabilistically!

Luckily, since our TA is very smart, we were able to find some secret codes she left behind. Team Six Detective Agency spent a long time creating different methods of both encoding (or encrypting) as well as decypting (solving) different methods of ciphers
