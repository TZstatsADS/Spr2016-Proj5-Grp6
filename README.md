# Project CatsDogs: Predictive analytics-model evaluation and selection

#### - for cats versus dogs image data
>>>>>>> parent of 29db763... Set Up Repo with folders

Read [full project description](doc/project3_desc.md)

In this project, we will carry out model evaluation and selection for predictive analytics on image data. As data scientists, we often need to evaluate different modeling/analysis strategies and decide what is the best. Such decisions need to be supported with sound evidence in the form of model assessment, validation and comparison. In addition, we also need to communicate our decision and supporting evidence clearly and convincingly in an accessible fashion.
